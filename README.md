# Epochly CLI

For use when developing the [Epochly App](https://epochlyapp.com). Open sourced both for internal development convenience, and hopefully as a helpful example for teams trying to do something similar.

This is not a standalone library, but rather a packaged CLI that is probably only useful for our unique purposes. YMMV!

## Contributing

Unless you are part of Epochly / 4Thought Studios development team, its probably not work contributing as this is for us. That being said, I'm not going to deny PRs or anything!
